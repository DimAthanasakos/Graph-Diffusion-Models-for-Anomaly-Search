# Graph-Diffusion-Model for anomaly detection

Use of graph theoretic priors to improve performance of Diffusion based anomaly search at particle colliders. 


To train the model you can run:
```bash
python train.py
```

check the arg parse arguments for more details. For more details on the different graph constructions, chech this ["repo"](https://github.com/DimAthanasakos/GNNs-and-Jets).
